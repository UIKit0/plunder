# Plunder [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/city41/plunder.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/city41/plunder)

A tween based animation system for JavaScript game engines. Ported over from my L7 engine and used in my game Dragon Plunder. More to come.

Plunder is a powerful, expressive animation system that really helps out simple game engines like ImpactJS. Even in more full fledged engines
such as Lime, you may still prefer to use Plunder over the built in system, it's goal is to be that good.

Much more to come, this repo is very young
