# Plunder [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/city41/plunder.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/city41/plunder) [![Stories in Ready](http://badge.waffle.io/city41/plunder.png)](http://waffle.io/city41/plunder)

[Plunder's website](http://city41.github.io/plunder)

A tween based animation system for JavaScript game engines. Ported over from my L7 engine and was used in my game Dragon Plunder. 

Plunder is a powerful, expressive animation system that really helps out simple game engines like ImpactJS. Even in more full fledged engines
such as Lime, you may still prefer to use Plunder over the built in system, it's goal is to be that good.

## Early Stuff So Far

Plunder is about 2 days old at this point. I started porting it over from existing code and organizing it. The `built` directory will eventually contain a consumable version, but for now it's just the coffee files compiled and concatted together. If you are adventurous and curious, your best bet right now is to see how [Plunder's website](http://city41.github.io/plunder) did the main example. But probably better to just wait :)

## And on the website

It will change and grow a lot. Just an initial prototype thrown up for now.
